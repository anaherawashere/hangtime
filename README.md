# Hangtime

**Hangtime** is a simple scheduling tool for friends to find the best time to hang out. The organiser picks a few date options, shares a link, and everyone selects the dates they're free. Hangtime shows which date works best for the group — no more endless group chats.

## Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript** – Frontend UI
- **Styled Components** – Styling with scoped CSS-in-JS
- **Express.js** – Backend server
